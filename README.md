# Setup Guidelines

## Backend

### PostgreSql

#### Mac
**Server**: Install Postgres.app, which should be the easiest way to install the server. Follow this [link](https://postgresapp.com/) for installation details. Once setup successfully, you should be able to start/close server by opening/closing the Postgres.app. The server will be ready once you open the app and waiting for connections.

**Client**: From Postgres.app, simply click on any database youâ€™d like to connect to. It will automatically open up Terminal or iTerm (depending on your setting in Preferences) with psql CLI running.

After these, you should configure your user's information in `src/configs/db.js`. You should create a database in the postsql server use `CREATE DATABASE cuhub;` (I would like to highlight the `;` sign, make sure it is at the end of the command) also make sure the database's name is cuhub. Note: 

### Node.js and npm
Recommend use `nvm` to install the `Node.js` as well as `npm`. 
Follow this [link](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script) to install nvm. To install Node.js as well as npm, simply use command `nvm install node`. Note: If you are facing any problem relating to `node: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version GLIBC_2.28' not found (required by node)` error, please use command `nvm install 17` instead. After having npm set-up, you can use `npm -v` to check for installation. 

Then, run the following commands in your working directory to set up package files and express:  
```bash
# Set up the package.json. You may ignore if you've got one
npm init -y
# Set up the express and pg modules
npm i express pg
```

### Table Manipulation
Table Creation:  

```bash
node ./src/scripts/db_create.js
```

Table Deletion: (Delete the table as well as the data)

```bash
node ./src/scripts/db_delete.js
```

Load Data: (TODO)
