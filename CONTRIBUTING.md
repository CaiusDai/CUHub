# Contributing guideline

You should follow the steps below to make contribution to the project:

## Submit a PR

### Commit Title convention

Please be descriptive when you commit your code. A good practice is to follow the format below:  
[Part] <Commit summary\>, for example:

```
[Database][Schema] Create the schema of the database
```

### PR Title convention

A valid PR title should begin with one of the following prefix: 

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `doc`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
- `ci`: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- `revert`: Reverts a previous commit
